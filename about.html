            <h1>What is UC Open Data?</h1>
            <p>
                Originally created in 2019, UC Open Data is <i>UChicago's first and only open data project.</i> We focus
                on collecting, creating, analyzing, and sharing data/data products related to UChicago. More specifically, this
                involves:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Scraping websites (ethically) to organize data into a readable format</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Reaching out to representatives of student government / UChicago admin to obtain data that otherwise wouldn't be accessible</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Pushing this data we obtain onto a website for members of our community to use</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Analyzing and visualizing the data we obtain to understand the data we find</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Writing journalistic articles to explain the data's story and reach broader audiences</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>And much more!</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
